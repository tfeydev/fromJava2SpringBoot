# Java Loops (Section 03)

This section introduces repetition and iteration using Java loops.

## Topics Covered

- `for` loops (with increments, countdowns)
- `while` loops (with unknown iteration count)
- `do-while` loops (always runs at least once)
- `break` and `continue` statements
- Nested loops (e.g. multiplication tables)
- User-controlled loops (e.g. continue with Y/N prompt)

## Learning Goals

✔ Learn the difference between `for`, `while`, and `do-while`  
✔ Control loop flow with conditions and user input  
✔ Write clean and readable loop structures
